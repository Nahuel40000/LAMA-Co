# UniBooks
UniBooks is a software that was developed by a team of 4 students
of the univsersity of Lausanne (Unil). It aims to ease the process
of buying and selling second-hand books on the campus.
Through the use of the Google Books API, creating an offer is really easy,
which makes the process of selling books that much faster.

Though it still has some issues, the main structure is here and functional.
We, as a team, are interested in furthering this project to turn it into a fully-operational smartphone application, which would, ideally, replace the current "Bourse aux Livres" system in place. Many technical difficulties prevented us from delivering the best project possible within the deadline.

We hope that you will see that this project was made with the passion of tryharding students and invite you to visit the different websites that made this project possible:
